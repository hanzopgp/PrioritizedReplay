## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To run this code you will need MATLAB 2016a or newer.

```
Give examples
```

### Simulation code

The main simulation code is located in:

```
replaySim.m
```

Other files in the directory needed for running the simulation:

```
pAct.m
stNac2stp1Nr.m
gainTerm.m
needTerm.m
plotMazeWithArrows.m
```

## Running the simulation

To run the simulation, set the parameters on:

```
setParams.m
```

For an example of how to run a simulation from start to finish, after cloning the directory with all files, run:

```
runSimulation_openMaze.m
```
